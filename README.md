Finding music that fits a certain mood or style is made easier by the classification of songs into genres based on shared features. 
Every genre has its own typical instruments, rhythms, and themes, whether it's pop, jazz, hip-hop, rock, or classical.
We can explore music by vibe with the help of genres, such as danceable, deep, calming, or energetic.
